                <p><a href="greensFunctionRadiation.pdf" target="_blank">Green's Functions+Radiation</a>-These notes are on a general solution of Maxwell's equations and the mathematical object we use to construct it. They
                    assume a prior knowledge of the electromagnetic potentials, gauges, and Maxwell's equations as well as all the requisite
                    math for those fields.
                </p>
                <p><a href="keplersLaws.pdf" target="_blank">Kepler's Laws</a>-These notes derive Kepler's laws using classical mechanics, specifically they apply a Lagrangian technique to get the equations
                    of motion, also assumes basic knowledge of conic sections (ellipses, hyperbolas, etc...), if you understand that you have everything you need for these.
                </p>
                <p> <a href="eulerEq.pdf" target="_blank">Euler Equation</a>-These notes derive Euler's equation from a macroscopic (not kinetic theory) point of view. They require an understanding
                    of multivariable and vector calculus, they also include a cool physical example of how the equation (when combined with 
                    an equation from plasma physics) was used to predict solar winds.
                </p>
                <p><a href="blackbodySpectrum.pdf" target="_blank">Blackbody Spectrum</a>-A discussion of the ultraviolet catastrophe and the creation of Planck's law which was the first window we had into quantum
                    theory. These notes assume a familiarity with statistical mechanics, and electricity and magnetism. 
                </p>
                <p><a href="maxwellDistribution.pdf" target="_blank">Maxwell Distribution</a>- A derivation of the distribution of speeds
                    in an ideal gas from just the assumption that the gas is isotropic, one of my favorite derivations ever. Assumes knowledge of
                    the ideal gas law and how temperature is related to average velocity (and related math), also assumes basic knowledge of statistics definitions.
    
                </p>
                <p><a href="superballs.pdf" target="_blank">Superballs</a>- A discussion of one of my favorite physics problems, just assumes
                    a basic familiarity with classical mechanics (i.e. intro physics class level). I reccomend attempting it yourself before reading
                    the solution later in the PDF because it is just a great problem :).

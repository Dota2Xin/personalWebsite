                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>I am a physics major at UC Santa Barbara (class of 2025) who loves engineering and science in general. I am particularly
                        passionate about applied physics, computer science/architecture, materials science (with a focus on applications to 
                        battery technology), and the intersection of these ideas in computational materials/physics. I currently work on 
                        theoretical/computational astrophysics studying supernovae in binary star systems with Lars Bildsten and Logan Prust at
                        the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics. I have previously worked on quantum information and condensed matter experimental physics
                        with Ania Jayich at UC Santa Barbara. I am currently looking for work after graduation in any technical field with interesting problems to solve.

                <h3>This Site</h3>
                <p>This website has a few pages. The first is general physics/materials/math/CS educational material that I've made and want to put
                    on the site. The second page is my portfolio, this has any programming/personal projects I want to display/talk about. The final
                    page is a page that will have my full CV (every job worked/paper published/talk given/etc...).

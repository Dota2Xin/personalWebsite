        <h3>Solar System Simulation</h1>
        <p>[Link to github or whatever]</p>
        <p>This project runs a simulation of our very own solar system using a stable long time integration scheme and initial conditions
            from NASA. It has two main parts, the first is a 3D environment you can explore and add your own objects to with more instructions
            on the Github. The second is a barebones UI that will let you put in your own initial conditions and then run the simulation outputing
            the numerical results to a txt file in a directory of your choice (once again more info on github). Feel free to use this for whatever you want
            (especially anything related to physics/science education)

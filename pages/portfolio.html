                    <a href="https://github.com/Dota2Xin/SolarSystemSimulation" target="_blank">Github</a>
                    <p>This project runs a simulation of our very own solar system using a stable long time integration scheme and initial conditions
                        from NASA. It has two main parts, the first is a 3D environment you can explore and add your own objects to with more instructions
                        on the Github. The second is a barebones UI that will let you put in your own initial conditions and then run the simulation outputing
                        the numerical results to a txt file in a directory of your choice (once again more info on github). Feel free to use this for whatever you want
                        (especially anything related to physics/science education)
                    </p>
